**Lab for Intelligence and visiON (LION)** commits to designing trustworthy intelligent visual recognition systems for real-world applications. To achieve this goal, we mainly focus on the areas of data augmentation, unsupervised/weakly-/semi-supervised learning, federated learning, domain generalization/adaptation and novel class discovery, and investigate their advantages in visual tasks, such as object retrieval, image classification, semantic segmentation, multi-modality recognition, etc. Our research outcomes are targeting top-tier venues, including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, IJCV, TPAMI, etc. LION is also a part of Laboratory for Multimedia Computing (LMC).

**Join Us:** We are looking for highly-motivated students. Please see the [Details](/joinus/).
